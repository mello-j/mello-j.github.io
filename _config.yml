          Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to lead and manage projects to successful outcomes, focusing on efficient communication, collaboration, and strategy. These projects have varied from Higher Education (helping deliver University courses on tight timelines) to the corporate world (system critical transitions).
          In all these experiences, I've learned that providing excellent support and communication throughout all stages of a project, to all involved stakeholders, is just as essential as the actual project "work"!

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
