         Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to lead and manage projects to successful outcomes, focusing on efficient communication, collaboration, and strategy. These projects have varied from Higher Education, helping deliver University courses on tight timelines, and to the corporate world where production would have been significantly implemented if unsuccessful! 
         In all these experiences I’ve learned that providing excellent support and communication throughout all stages of the project, to all stakeholders, can be just as important as the actual project “work”.

         I completed my education in Grand Junction, CO, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.96 out of 4.0 on a 3 ½ year accelerated timeline. I earned a bachelor’s degree with a major in Criminal Justice and a minor in Psychology, encompassing over 142 credits. 
         Throughout my studies, I took additional coursework in Research Methods and Statistics and ended up tutoring numerous students in both subject areas.
         After a significant educational hiatus, I returned to school with the goal of completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science to expand my technical skills, knowledge of software development, databases, and mathematical analysis in the hopes of integrating all these skills and applying them in the business world. 
         I hope to continue my studies in Graduate school after completing this second-degree program.
         
         Along with my formal education – I’ve taken advantage of training courses on Coursera, and LinkedIn Learning to obtain certificates in Data Analytics, Project Management, and hope to obtain a Business Intelligence certificate at the end of August.
         These education opportunities have developed skill sets in a wide range of tools and technologies particularly Microsoft Office Suite, SQL, Java, JavaScript/Google Apps Script, and Python which I hope to use to automate tasks, analyze data, and produce value!


  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Beyond my professional and educational pursuits, I am an Avid Skier and Snowboarder (averaging 40+ days on the hill a year!). 
      Bogus Basin is one of the best values out there, but I’m always drawn to the Mountain ranges of the Teton, Wasatch, the Sierra Nevada, the Rockies, and a visit to the Blue over in Eastern Oregon. I’m still exploring the DIY opportunities out there where I’ve tinkered with car repair, bike repair, paddleboard repair (ever have a paddleboard blow a seam? It’s not pretty!), ski/snowboard maintenance, and other home projects. 
      For some reason along the way, I’ve formed a habit of collecting Funko Pops (mostly Star Wars and Marvel, with a few popular TV show characters thrown in).

      Enough talking! I invite you to check out my Resume, reach out to Contact me or grab a coffee, and hopefully soon explore some GitHub Repositories that showcase my coding projects, scripts, and contributions as I continue to develop my programming skills. 
      If you have any questions, or would like to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for visiting and I hope you’ve found value in this page!
