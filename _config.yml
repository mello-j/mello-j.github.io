          Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong ability to lead and manage projects to successful outcomes, focusing on efficient communication, collaboration, and strategy. These projects have varied from Higher Education (helping deliver University courses on tight timelines) to the corporate world (system critical transitions).
          In all these experiences, I've learned that providing excellent support and communication throughout all stages of a project, to all involved stakeholders, is just as essential as the actual project "work"!

         In my role as an Online Course Technologist at Boise State University, I have the privilege of supporting various programs, including Cyber Operations, Genetic Counseling, and Profession and Continuing Education courses. This broad scope allows me to engage with a diverse range of subjects and educational initiatives.

         My responsibilities encompass a wide range of tasks aimed at ensuring smooth course operations. This includes providing high-level support in course maintenance, design, accessibility, revised development, and course launch. I take pride in assisting instructors and faculty members in navigating the intricacies of the Canvas learning management system (LMS). Additionally, I offer training on basic Canvas LTI (Learning Technology Integration) usage and assist in troubleshooting technical issues related to Canvas and commonly used LTI tools.

         Working in this role has afforded me the opportunity to develop strong project management skills. The dynamic nature of the position has also allowed me to interact with the Canvas REST API, enabling me to explore new scripting techniques and methods for automating tasks and increasing overall efficiency. This exposure to scripting and automation has been instrumental in enhancing my technical capabilities and finding innovative solutions to streamline workflows.

         During my time at Boise Cascade, I gained extensive experience in various areas including Analytics, Project Management, Sales/Negotiation, Customer Support, Logistics/Operations, and Technical Support. Working within a dynamic department, I had the opportunity to contribute to a wide range of services provided by our team. This involved actively participating in growing internal knowledge, developing supporting documentation, conducting training sessions for both internal and external departments, and coordinating user testing of our systems with cross-functional teams.

         One of my key responsibilities was overseeing the transportation reporting metrics, which were shared throughout the company, including with Executive Leadership. I ensured that accurate and meaningful transportation supply forecasts were provided and made myself available to address any questions or engage in discussions regarding transportation-related matters. Boise Cascade offered an environment that allowed me to blend and enhance a diverse set of skills, combining both soft and hard skills, which are essential in today's technology-driven positions. This experience provided a solid foundation for my professional growth and development.

         After a significant formal education hiatus, I returned to school with the goal of completing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science to expand my technical skills, knowledge of software development, databases, and mathematical analysis. I would like to integrate these skill sets and apply them in the business world while continuing my education into Graduate school.

         So far my coursework includes Calculus I, Calculus II, Discrete Mathematics, Computer Science I, Computer Science II, Software Development in C, Intro to Database Systems Usage, Intro to Version Control, Web Development, Navigating Computer Systems (Linux), and R programming.

         I completed my education in Grand Junction, CO graduating Summa Cum Laude with a GPA of 3.96 on a 4.0 scale. I managed to do this while working multiple part-time jobs (most notably as a Statistics Tutor and Data Analyst Intern!). I finished in 3 1/2 years with 142 credits, well over the requirements for my degree due to significant coursework taken in Statistics and Research Methods.

    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Beyond my professional and educational pursuits, I am an Avid Skier and Snowboarder (averaging 40+ days on the hill a year!). Bogus Basin is one of the best values out there, but I’m always drawn to the Mountain ranges of the Teton, Wasatch, the Sierra Nevada, the Rockies, and a visit to the Blue over in Eastern Oregon. 
      I’m still exploring the DIY opportunities out there where I’ve tinkered with car repair, bike repair, paddleboard repair (ever have a paddleboard blow a seam? It’s not pretty!), ski/snowboard maintenance, and other home projects. 
      For some reason along the way, I’ve formed a habit of collecting Funko Pops (mostly Star Wars and Marvel, with a few popular TV show characters thrown in).

      Enough talking! I invite you to check out my Resume, reach out to Contact me or grab a coffee, and hopefully soon explore some GitHub Repositories that showcase my coding projects, scripts, and contributions as I continue to develop my programming skills. 
      If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations or opportunities, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for visiting and I hope you’ve found value in this page!
